Write an iOS app following VIPER architecture. But in an **easy way**.

----------

## Viper the easy way
We all know Viper is cool. But we also know that it's hard to setup. This library intends to simplify all that boilerplate process.

## Create Viper Modules Right From Xcode

With the provided Xcode template you just have to click <i class="icon-file"></i> **New file** in the document panel and select Viperit Module creation template.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

Specify Viperit into your project's Podfile:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'Viperit'
```

TODO
-------------

Documentation will be added **soon** (Clone the repo and run the Xcode project to see it in action)
